This year, we will examine intellectual property and innovation with regard to platforms. In particular, as platforms have matured, we will study issues that arise with regard to copyright, trademark, trade secrecy, patent, and antitrust in the context of platforms (including social media, ecommerce, and search platforms). We will also explore underlying aspects of innovation theory in relation to platforms.</p><h2 id="spring-2023-schedule-of-presenters">Spring 2023 Schedule of Presenters</h2><h3 id="thursday-january-19">Thursday, January 19</h3><h4 id="abhay-aneja-assistant-professor-of-law-uc-berkeley-school-of-law"><a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/abhay-aneja/#tab_profile">Abhay Aneja</a>, Assistant Professor of Law, UC Berkeley School of Law</h4><p><strong><em>Strengthening State Capacity: Public Service Delivery &amp; Innovation during the Gilded Age (with Guo Xu)</em></strong></p><p>Abstract: We use newly digitized records from the U.S. Post Office to study the effects of strengthened state capacity in over 2,700 cities between 1875-1905. Exploiting the staggered implementation of the Pendleton Act – a landmark statute which shielded bureaucrats from political interference – we find that the civil service reform reduced postal delivery errors and increased productivity. These improvements were most pronounced during election years when the reform dampened bureaucratic turnover. Finally, we show that reformed cities witnessed declining local partisan newspapers and increased patenting. Separating politics from administration, therefore, not only improved state effectiveness but also resulted in wider economic benefits.</p><h3 id="thursday-january-26">Thursday, January 26</h3><h4 id="eric-e-johnson-earl-sneed-centennial-professor-of-law-university-of-oklahoma-college-of-law"><a href="http://ericejohnson.com/">Eric E.

The controversy arises when a platform company—most famously Amazon—uses its platform to host a marketplace for independent retailers while simultaneously hosting itself as a retailer on the platform, thus competing as a retailer with an inside advantage. Critics say this setup allows platform firms to cherry-pick the best product ideas from small, independent retailers and then hijack their sales. This Essay seeks to advance the conversation about this controversy, making at least four contributions. First, this Essay shows that the complained-about problem—in which platform providers take sales away from platform participants—is not best understood as a competition-harming concern but as an innovation-harming concern. Second, and following from the first point, this Essay suggests such problems are productively viewed as challenges for the domain of intellectual property law rather than, or in addition to, the domain of antitrust law. Third, this Essay explains how the particular anti-innovative harm in this area is to soft innovation, which is distinguished from the type of hard innovation that is the principal concern of copyright and patent law. Previously, such soft innovation has been incentivized by the lure of supracompetitive profits that are sustained by market friction, often spoken of as “first-mover advantage.” The reduction of that market friction by way of technology-enabled platform commerce has had the effect of subverting the innovation incentives that naturally existed in the brick-and-mortar world. Fourth, this Essay provides an initial foray into thinking about how a new intellectual property entitlement should be designed. To that end, this Essay identifies various ways of attempting to ensure that a newly created intellectual property right in this area does not do more harm than good.</p><h3 id="thursday-february-2">Thursday, February 2</h3><h4 id="daniel-francis-assistant-professor-of-law-nyu-school-of-law">Daniel Francis, Assistant Professor of Law, NYU School of Law</h4><p><strong>TBA</strong></p><p>Abstract: TBA</p><h3 id="thursday-february-9">Thursday, February 9</h3><h4 id="christopher-sprigman-murray-and-kathleen-bring-professor-of-law-nyu-school-of-law">Christopher Sprigman, Murray and Kathleen Bring Professor of Law, NYU School of Law</h4><p><strong><em>The Paradox of Privacy Regulation: How Law Meant To Protect Privacy Can Erode It (with Stephan Tontrup)</em></strong></p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how people make privacy decisions online in a low-information environment. We hypothesize that people frame these decisions as bilateral interactions, and that they employ a counterfactual heuristic—i.e., that they assess the action space of their counterparty (i.e., the choices available to the counterparty; in this context, regarding which privacy protections to offer), and they identify the counterparty as a positive-intention type if he or she appears to be taking the most benevolent action available within that perceived action space (in this context, offering the best available privacy protection), and, conversely, as a negative-intention type if he or she appears to be taking an action that is not the most benevolent available in the perceived action space (in this context, failing to offer a privacy protection that appears to be available). We test this hypothesis with three mixed lab/field experiments. In our first experiment, we confirm that subjects making privacy decisions in our experimental setting employ the counterfactual heuristic. In our second experiment, we find that subjects employing the counterfactual heuristic will tend to ignore otherwise valid social cues about trustworthiness in favor of the heuristic. In our third experiment, we find that subjects employing the heuristic also tend to ignore information about the possible social effects of their privacy decisions—i.e., the extent to which the subject’s decision about their own privacy will tend to affect the privacy interests of others. In all of these experiments, we also employ a method for blocking subjects’ use of the heuristic. When we do so, we see subjects change their behavior substantially, including taking advantage of otherwise valid social cues about trustworthiness and increased consideration of the social risks of disclosure.</p><h3 id="thursday-february-23">Thursday, February 23</h3><h4 id="joris-van-hoboken-professor-of-law-vrije-universiteit-brussels"><a href="https://lsts.research.vub.be/en/joris-van-hoboken">Joris van Hoboken</a>, Professor of Law, Vrije Universiteit Brussels</h4><h3 id="thursday-march-2">Thursday, March 2</h3><h4 id="evelyn-douek-assistant-professor-of-law-stanford-law-school"><a href="https://www.evelyndouek.com/">Evelyn Douek</a>, Assistant Professor of Law, Stanford Law School</h4><p><strong><em>What is the Measure of Good Speech Governance?
