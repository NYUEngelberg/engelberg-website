For 30 years, beginning in 1983, I was an equity partner in major law firms and a specialist in patent litigation. I was a pioneer among women patent trial lawyers. I tried my first case as lead trial counsel (“First Chair”) in 1987. I believed that the barriers I faced early in my career would be more easily overcome as more women entered the practice. The underrepresentation of women in leading roles in law firms was an increasing focus of bar associations, law firms, and judges and courts. Innumerable articles were written, speeches given, and conferences held. However, in recent years, despite this attention, it became clear that women’s progress was not as it should be. This led to my work at the Engelberg Center at the NYU School of Law and this article. I wanted to know if the percentage of women among First Chairs in patent litigation was improving over the years, and if not, why. To know the answers to my questions, I needed data.</p><p>I read relevant writings and reports about women’s progress in the law and gender equality in the United States. I was unable to find any public data which would help answer my question forcommercial litigation, much less patent litigation, in federal district courts around the country. This lack of data is very significant. If women’s service as First Chairs cannot be readily and reliably tracked, then we cannot know whether current diversity efforts are succeeding and what improvements should be made.</p><p>This led me to my own data gathering. I am deeply grateful to Lex Machina, which generously gave me complimentary access to its entire database of the court records of intellectual property cases, which begins in 2009. I reviewed the record of every patent trial in the years 2010 and 2019—over 200 cases—and determined the percentage of women among all of the First Chairs in those trials. As I shall explain, the results were disappointing. I compared the results I obtained with those compiled by authors writing about women arguing appeals in patent cases and women representing parties in proceedings held pursuant to the America Invents Act in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. I also conducted interviews of women lawyers, including six of the women First Chairs in 2019 patent trials.</p><p>I report on what I learned and the barriers I identified to gender equality in this practice and suggest a positive path forward of greater attention to the importance of diversity and inclusion.</p><p>I would like to thank the Engelberg Center and Michael Weinberg, its executive director, for their support and encouragement of my work reflected in this article. Thanks also to Professor Rochelle Dreyfuss, Professor Paul R. Gugliuzza and Dr. Julie Blackman for providing helpful comments. Finally, I express my appreciation to Lex Machina and its executive Joshua Harvey for providing me with complimentary access to the company&#39;s database of patent cases which was instrumental to my research.</p><p>I. Introduction</p><p>For trial lawyers, the ultimate career goal is to become a First Chair trial lawyer. First Chairs take the lead in formulating case and trial strategy, handling court room presentations and witness examinations, and communicating with judges and juries. In selecting litigation counsel for a case of significance, a client’s primary focus is on the attorney who will be First Chair at any trial, and, in particular, that attorney’s trial record. Whether or not a client actually wants to try the case, or hopes to resolve it pre-trial, that client knows that selecting a good First Chair will be important in achieving a good result no matter the stage at which a case is resolved.</p><p>Further, a trial lawyer’s strength as a First Chair directly impacts her ability to bring in new cases (known as making “rain”). Generating significant revenue is key to a partner’s status and compensation. This relates directly to another gender parity problem—the status of women partners in law firms and their compensation. Before there can be gender parity in compensation, there needs to be gender parity in opportunity. It is the pervasive lack of opportunity that is the focus of this paper.</p><p>I began traversing the path leading to First Chair status almost 50 years ago, when I graduated from the NYU School of Law in 1973. In 1983, I became a partner in the firm of Fish &amp; Neave. I was the first woman in the United States to become a partner in a major patent law firm.1 From 1977 until my retirement from Biglaw at the end of 2013, my primary focus was patent litigation. Not just discovery and pre-trial motions, , but trial work. Many litigators rarely if ever actually try a case. I was a trial lawyer, and like all trial lawyers, from the time I was a junior lawyer, I aspired to lead trial counsel (“First Chair”) status on trial teams.</p><p>During the 1980s and 1990s I faced barriers affecting all women lawyers and struggled to attain the role of First Chair. I ultimately succeeded. During my law firm career, I was the First Chair in more than 45 cases, and tried 12 cases to a verdict or judgment, some as First Chair. I had a major role in the landmark trials in Polaroid v. Kodak (infringement of Polaroid instant photography patents) and NBA v. Motorola (intellectual property rights in the scores and statistics of NBA basketball games).2</p><p>While the status of women lawyers in patent litigation has improved since the 1990s, despite the passage of decades, barriers still exist, and I continued to experience them during my career. There is widespread acknowledgment of women’s underrepresentation in leading roles in the legal profession generally. Many articles have been written and many conferences have been held about possible solutions to this problem. Bar associations conduct studies and have committees focusing on the progress of women. Many law firms have diversity officers and programs and promote their diversity efforts. Judges and courts have become sensitive to this problem and encourage counsel to give more courtroom work to younger and more diverse lawyers. Clients have demanded greater diversity from their outside counsel trial teams.</p><p>But from everything I heard or read, despite the public attention to gender disparity in law firms and in the courtroom, the needle of woman’s service as First Chairs, in litigation generally and in patent litigation specifically, was not moving. I wanted to help move that needle. All of this led me to the Engelberg Center at the NYU School of Law and my work on this paper.3</p><p>My investigation revealed that, indeed, the needle was not moving. Lex Machina data established that in 2010, women comprised 8.1% of First Chairs at trial in patent cases. In 2019, women comprised 9.9% of First Chairs at trials of such cases. Plainly, despite all the talk, the needle barely moved over a 10 year period.4 At the current rate, it will take women at least 56 years to achieve gender parity as First Chairs in patent trials. These numbers are consistent with the related research of other investigators.</p><p>My study also concluded that in 2010 and 2019, women were significantly underrepresented in the category of First Chairs handling jury trials. Because jury trials are preferred in most types of patent litigation, this trend suggests a limit on women’s opportunities to serve as First Chairs. Another significant finding is that in 2019 trials, women tended to litigate patents in the life sciences area and not in the many other technologies that were the subject of patent trials that year. Although most of the women First Chairs in that year have undergraduate degrees in biology or chemistry, the women I interviewed discounted this credential as significant to clients. This issue of whether women are being held to a different standard as compared to men deserves further attention. If a lawyer’s undergraduate degree is of more significance to clients or firms for women as compared to men, the fact that the most popular undergraduate degree for women in STEM5 is life sciences suggests that fewer women are likely to be selected as First Chairs for cases involving technologies such as electronics, semiconductors, telecommunications, or computers. This would be another limit on women’s opportunities. This paper continues with an exploration of factors underlying the data, including a) entrenched gender inequality generally in the United States, b) the existence of implicit bias, and c) the structure of law firms, including an overemphasis on billable hours and the failure to put equity partners at the center of diversity efforts.</p><p>This paper concludes with a positive path forward focused on law firms and equity partners. That path includes the active involvement of equity partners incentivized by a partner compensation system that meaningfully rewards partners financially for providing mentoring, training, and client opportunities for diverse lawyers, including women, at both the associate and partner levels. Such a path does not need to result in declining profits. If properly conducted, these actions should be profit enhancing. The final recommendation is that law firms must employ quantitative metrics to track the progress of all lawyers, including diverse lawyers. Without meaningful data, it is impossible to track the success of diversity efforts.</p><h2 class="heading" id="ii-the-methodology-of-the-first-phase-of-my-investigation">II. The Methodology of the First Phase of My Investigation</h2><h3 class="heading" id="a-defining-the-scope-of-my-investigation">A. Defining the Scope of My Investigation</h3><p>To determine the progress of women’s status as First Chairs in patent litigation, data is required. But we want to collect the right data which most accurately reflects the path to First Chair. And, any analysis must be nationwide. Patent litigation tends to be nationwide practice. Patent trial lawyers are located throughout the country and travel to federal courts throughout the country.</p><p>In determining the data to collect, I also considered that the path to First Chair status is a long one, that patent cases are expensive to litigate and have serious business consequences for both sides. Damages can be very significant. Unlike typical commercial litigation, injunctions are available to end infringing activity.6 For these reasons, patent litigation has been referred to as “the sport of kings.”7</p><p>As a consequence, clients want very experienced First Chairs. In my experience, it takes 15 to 20 years of experience after law school graduation for a trial lawyer to be ready to take on the role of a First Chair in significant patent litigation. This means focus on attorneys at the partner level. Clients also want First Chairs from firms that routinely handle major litigation in the federal courts, which have exclusive jurisdiction over patent cases. This means focusing on law firms that routinely handle significant litigation, including patent litigation.</p><p>I decided that ideally, I wanted to track the nationwide percentage of women among the following populations.</p><ul><li><p>Law students</p></li><li><p>Lawyers in private law firms likely to handle patent litigation</p></li><li><p>Partners in law firms likely to handle patent litigation</p></li><li><p>Partners in those law firms whose practice includes patent litigation</p></li><li><p>First Chairs in patent litigation</p></li></ul><p>I found considerable data for categories A through C. This data supports the widely known fact that women are underrepresented in law firm partnerships. Much has been written on this issue, and an analysis of the reasons for this gender disparity is beyond the scope of this paper. But data for these categories does provide context for the data I was particularly interested in—categories D and E. Women never get to categories D or E unless they pass through the gates of categories A through C. This paper focuses on the experiences of that select group of women who get to category D. If the percentage of women in categories D and E were comparable, then a particular focus of inquiry should be on getting more women to become partners and handle patent litigation. If, by contrast, the percentage of women in category E was meaningfully smaller than the percentage of women in category D, then the focus of inquiry should shift to the career development of the partners.</p><p>Despite the widespread recognition of the lack of women serving as First Chairs in patent litigation, and the noteworthy efforts of so many organizations, I found no statistically reliable data for categories D and E. I did find limited reliable data on the percentage of women who served as lead trial counsel in commercial litigation and, in one case, IP litigation (which includes trademarks and copyrights as well as patents).8 I also had some anecdotal media reports in my own files.</p><p>Ultimately, as I will explain in more detail below, because of the generosity of Lex Machina, which offered me the complementary use of their fulsome database on patent trials from 2009 to 2020, supplemented by my own experience as a trial lawyer, and other information that can be obtained from public sources including PACER, I was able to reliably prepare my own set of data in category E by determining the percentage of women who served as First Chairs in actual patent trials in 2010 and 2019. I was not able to develop a comparable set of data for category D.</p><h3 class="heading" id="b-pre-existing-data-collected-by-others">B. Pre-Existing Data Collected by Others</h3><p>Despite the limitations of the pre-existing data collected by others, it does provide valuable context for the Lex Machina analysis in terms of measuring the overall progress of women lawyers, particularly those wishing to pursue a career as a trial lawyer. For this reason, before proceeding to the Lex Machina analysis, I will provide an analysis of the most meaningful data sources, keyed to the categories described above.</p><h4 class="heading" id="1-category-a-data-on-the-percentage-of-women-among-law-students">1. Category A–Data on the Percentage of Women Among Law Students</h4><p>Comprehensive data about the percentage of women attending law school can be found in the report entitled The American Bar Association’s Report, First Year and Total Enrollment by Gender 1947-2011 (“ABA Law School 1947-2011”).9 This data is based upon reporting by ABA accredited law schools. Given that the focus of my investigation is the period from 2010 to 2019, and that in my experience it can take 15-20 years to become qualified to be a First Chair, then it is particularly relevant to look at law school data for total enrollment during the years 1990-2004. I also reviewed additional ABA law school gender data for the years 2016-2018. The data shows that percentage of women law students enrolled in JD programs was never less than 42.5% (1990-1991) and had reached 47.5% by 1998-1999 and 48.7% by 2003-2004.10 By 2017, the percentage of women enrolled in JD programs had increased to 52.39%.11</p><h4 class="heading" id="2-categories-b-and-c-data-on-the-percentage-of-women-among-lawyers-and-partners-in-private-law-firms">2. Categories B and C–Data on the Percentage of Women Among Lawyers and Partners in Private Law Firms</h4><p>Data comparing the percentage of women among lawyers in private law firms to the percentage of women among partners in these law firms has been collected for decades. The result is always the same. The percentage of women among partners increases at a glacial pace and is always appreciably lower than the percentage of women among all lawyers at the pre-partner level in firms. Moreover, over some periods, the percentage of women among the ranks of associates declines. This is not surprising, given the gender disparity in career opportunities for women.</p><p><i>The American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession, Report to the House of Delegates (June 1988) (“ABA Women 1988”)12</i></p><p>The first American Bar Association report on the status of women was based upon “open hearings … written testimony, reports surveys and articles”13 The report focused on the significant barriers to the overall success of women in the profession and did not address the status of women lawyers in specific practice areas.</p><p>According to this study, women comprised 25% of all associates but only 6% of all partners in private practice. In the top 250 largest law firms, these percentages increased to 33% and 8% respectively. These numbers reflect the very slow progress women were making in becoming partners in the 1980s.14</p><p><i>The Glass Ceilings Report of 1995</i></p><p>In 1992, the New York City Bar Association engaged a study about how women were progressing at New York City’s largest law firms. The resulting Glass Ceilings Report,15 based upon data and interviews provided by eight “Wall Street Firms,” concluded that while women made up at least 40% of law school graduating classes, they were absent from the partnership ranks. In the year 1994, for example, 40% of the associates, but only 12% of the partners in these firms were women.16 The cause was identified as follows:</p><blockquote><p>“…[s]tereotyping,traditionalattitudesandbehaviorstowardswomen,oftenfocused on women’s roles as mothers…”17</p></blockquote><div class="table"><p class="table__title">Table 1.
