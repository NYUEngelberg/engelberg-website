Because the materials in question all come with an additional constraint—they are protected with digital locks. A professor hoping to show movie clips in her media studies class must first break those digital locks to copy the clips in question. And that’s a problem. Breaking a digital lock can be a violation of the law, even if done to make otherwise-lawful use of a copyrighted work.</p><p>And this is why 96 nonprofit organizations, law school clinics, trade associations, academics, companies, and individuals submitted over 1,000 pages of petitions, comments, opposition comments, and reply comments (in addition to participating in three days of public hearings) to the United States Copyright Office during this period, asking for permission to do things that they already are allowed to do under fair use.  </p><p>Nor is it the first time everyone has come together for this ritual. Since 2000, every three years they must come together to request—and oppose—limited exemptions to a law designed to protect the digital locks that prevent copying of digital works. These exceptions act as an additional round of permission for activities that, but for the use of digital locks, would already be protected under copyright law’s fair use exception.</p><p>This exercise exists because of 1998’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). That law created a specific provision—section 1201(a)(1)—giving additional legal protection to digital locks that prevent copying of digital works, independent of the copyright protection those works already enjoy. Circumventing the locks is a stand-alone violation of the law, even if the reason for the circumvention is perfectly legal.  </p><p>In order to prevent that additional protection from undermining socially beneficial activity, Congress created a process whereby temporary exemptions to the rules could be granted every three years.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="4E8jrOknniJiysMEW4l3eZ"></sup></p><p>Congress originally intended this triennial process to act as “a ‘fail-safe’ mechanism” to “ensure that access [to works] for lawful purposes is not unjustifiably diminished.”<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="1TfgWkUtpDQW2f5NelrYb4"></sup> While the process does serve that goal, it has also become a central focus of copyright policy advocacy in its own right.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="7ecEzMd17cXCQrshg2KCq1"></sup> It now claims countless hours of effort from the participants, as well as from Copyright Office staff and other parts of the federal government, on behalf of an ever-expanding collection of exemptions.  </p><p>At the same time, the law these exemptions are from is only occasionally used in court. Only 12 suits with a meaningful nexus to 1201(a)(1) were filed during the period covered by the previous triennial rules, five of which came from a single manufacturer of high-end design software. Each of these included underlying copyright claims, arguably making the law redundant. If the intended purpose of the law was the protection of creative works in the digital economy, the actual effect of the law is the creation of a bureaucratic sinkhole that draws in public interest organizations, academics, industry organizations, and the public every three years. They must do this, in part, because the government does not see its role as acting on behalf of the public interest itself. </p><p>Ultimately, the resources devoted to the bureaucratic process of exemption-granting almost certainly dwarf those devoted to enforcing the law itself. It is time to reexamine how well this provision “maintain[s] balance between the interests of content creators and information users”<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="28FKaWnlXK9ymVqcVsLQ17"></sup> and consider reforming it or abolishing it entirely.</p><h2 class="heading" id="what-was-section-1201-a-1-designed-to-do">What Was Section 1201(a)(1) Designed to Do?</h2><p>The prohibition against circumventing digital locks is contained in 17 U.S.C § 1201(a)(1), itself enacted as part of the larger Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). </p><p>Section 1201(a)(1) establishes a violation for “circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work [protected by copyright]”.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="1eNhTohxgYiZ24oK9Iq7eS"></sup> Essentially, this prohibits breaking or otherwise circumventing a digital lock that protects a work protected by copyright.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="2xdnXTJlbdUpKrJNupRN6c"></sup>  </p><p>(The provision describes digital locks used to limit the use of copyright-protected works as “technological measures,” and in other contexts they are referred to as “Technological Protection Measures (TPMs).” However, as most people know these locks as Digital Rights Management (DRM), in the interest of simplicity, that is the term used in this report.)</p><p>Section 1201(a)(1) creates an additional cause of action against copyright infringers. For example, making unauthorized copies of a movie in order to sell those copies to others infringes on the copyright in the movie itself. If that movie happens to be on a DVD, and is therefore protected by DRM, 1201(a)(1) creates an <i>additional</i> violation for breaking the digital lock that protects the movie as stored on the DVD. Because 1201(a)(1) is an additional violation, the bootlegger in question would be liable for both copyright infringement (making unauthorized copies of the movie) and circumvention (breaking the digital locks designed to prevent unauthorized copying in the first place).<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="2NgpiXY4jPTtAIP2lsomtS"></sup></p><p>Congress recognized that this new circumvention-based violation could also impose significant burdens on the public and act as a barrier to socially beneficial (and perfectly lawful) activity. In recognition of this, Congress wrote exceptions into the law itself for specific activities of libraries, archives, and educational institutions<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="MKG31rGYZzV2kjNVuPMjL"></sup>; law enforcement, intelligence, and other government activities<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="5xqsqnz2EyETzjMulaWthn"></sup>; reverse engineering<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="3qTxb8yroFZJSWDGpx61XQ"></sup>; encryption research<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="7pzAODYvFVB1x18QBIhRb1"></sup>; and security testing<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="6htIgj98xSe6ZWLNULWRqR"></sup>.</p><h3 class="heading" id="the-triennial-review-process-as-backstop">The Triennial Review Process as Backstop</h3><p>Congress understood that the prohibition against circumventing DRM would impact lawful uses of works beyond those explicitly listed in the statute. However, it did not create a general “fair use exemption” that would allow the breaking of digital locks in order to achieve otherwise legal ends.  </p><p>Instead, in addition to an enumerated list of specific exceptions, Congress created a triennial process to identify additional activity harmed by the prohibition against circumventing digital locks.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="5qlLYMTQyjC81gwBeFTkSe"></sup> As described in the legislative report accompanying the bill, “[t]he primary goal of the rulemaking proceeding is to assess whether the prevalence of these technological protections [DRM], with respect to particular categories of copyrighted materials, is diminishing the ability of individuals to use these works in ways that are otherwise lawful.”<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="6P67sml8ipvvu0VfyvMxxA"></sup> </p><p>Every three years the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress consider petitions from groups asserting that their noninfringing uses of copyright-protected works “are, or are likely to be, adversely affected” by rules preventing them from breaking digital locks.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="4xKblVwDTx1T1esvk5AkZg"></sup> This process is intended to “balance the interests of copyright owners and users, including the personal interests of consumers, in the digital environment.”<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="7v4fPMhEuezoKd5eEG4mWS"></sup> Although 1201(a)(1) sets a presumption that breaking digital locks is illegal, the triennial review process is an opportunity to allow the breaking of those locks for legitimate purposes.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="7j6CTu3DvSZ13dFFVNN2EK"></sup> Notably, exemptions granted through this process remain valid only until the completion of the next triennial review process–meaning they are good only for three years.</p><p>The mechanics of the review process have evolved over the past two decades, becoming somewhat more streamlined in recent years. The most recent, streamlined version includes the following steps<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="5bgDAApA0hAdLaV5dGZzlA"></sup>:</p><ol><li><p>The Copyright Office announces the start of the process. (The most recent process began on June 8, 2023.)</p></li><li><p>Supporters of existing exemptions file a request to renew those exemptions, including an explanation of why the exemption should be renewed.

(Supporters of existing exemptions can still file comments supporting the exemptions at this stage.) (August 11)</p></li><li><p>Supporters of new exemptions file a petition for the new exemption, or for the modification of an existing exemption.

In the current (2024) round, the Copyright Office supported the renewal of 38 existing exemptions. It failed to support the renewal of a 39th existing exemption because no parties submitted a petition for its renewal.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="15b9pKTUoWMdxWnc9wteP9"></sup> (October 19)</p></li><li><p>Proponents of exemptions file comments in support of those exemptions.

(October)</p></li><li><p>The Librarian of Congress formally approves and publishes the recommendations. (October 28)</p></li></ol><p>While this final step is required because the statute identifies the Librarian of Congress as the final authority on the matter, it is largely pro forma. The entire process is managed by the Copyright Office, and there is only one instance where the Librarian of Congress reversed a recommendation from the Register of Copyrights.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="7tufueW7KoPJWNzuOqcmzT"></sup> </p><h2 class="heading" id="the-triennial-review-process-imposes-significant-costs-on-the-public">The Triennial Review Process Imposes Significant Costs on the Public</h2><p>Although intended as a backstop to ensure that the public interest remains protected, the triennial review of proposed exemptions to 1201(a)(1) instead imposes significant costs on the public.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="1nR8K6cReZldubM1nOUJe3"></sup> Every three years, organizations and individuals must petition the Copyright Office to propose new exemptions to reflect the evolving state of technology and society. And, because all previously granted exemptions expire at the end of their three-year cycle, petitioners also have to request renewals or alterations for prior exemptions. These petitions are sometimes challenged by parties opposed to the exemptions, and they must be reviewed by Copyright Office staff.</p><p>Although Congress established a framework for the review process, there does not appear to be any record of it seriously considering the costs involved in its operation.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="4o4UHlqXd3qa5td3aWAdOk"></sup> Instead, it appears to have simply assumed that the petitions for exemptions in the public interest would materialize before the Copyright Office every three years.  </p><p>In practice, the work of drafting, supporting, and arguing for these petitions largely falls to uncompensated nonprofit organizations, academics, and law school clinics. Collectively, they represent thousands of hours spent advocating for the public’s ability to do what is already allowed under copyright law. This combined effort may be 1201(a)(1)’s most significant impact—an impact that is felt not by the copyright holder, who is already well protected by copyright law without it, but instead by public interest organizations that must find the capacity and time to participate in an extra bureaucratic procedure.</p><h3 class="heading" id="proceeding-participants">Proceeding Participants</h3><p>Every three years, the review process requires the mobilization of dozens of organizations and individuals for a multi-month adjudication process.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="5Bq8mc3W6WqjCjWVYmSfkH"></sup> The most recent proceeding involved 96 parties engaged with 22 renewal petitions and nine new exemption requests.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="2NHUx5zXOWwnQWNsXvnkUo"></sup> <sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="6jUZqyQsL5q4NADVupq9fG"></sup> Each of these petitions and requests involves hours of research, drafting, and coordination with similarly-situated individuals and groups.</p><p>This collective effort is required in part because the Copyright Office, although it recognizes its own authority to engage in independent fact-finding, does not exercise that authority<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="6muynF7vMZlMlEebJEWTsb"></sup> or see itself as a representative of the public interest in this proceeding.

Simply raising an issue in the hopes that the Copyright Office itself will use its authority to explore it further is not enough. </p><p>For example, in 2021, FloSports, Inc. petitioned the Copyright Office for an exemption related to recording livestreamed sporting events.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="SYeOMpNbNv6N9h8O5H8cu"></sup> As per the Copyright Office’s instructions, the petition provided information about the proposed exemption, the copyrighted works sought to be accessed, technological prevention measures (DRM) preventing such access, the noninfringing uses involved, and the adverse effects that the absence of the circumvention imposed.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="13dE4doLFOQSUzKFRWJ1BD"></sup></p><p>Although FloSports provided this information during the petition round of the proceeding, it did not participate in the more formal comment round that followed months later. The Free Software Foundation did engage with the petition in the comment round, submitting a comment in support of FloSports’ petition that was co-signed by 111 named individuals living in the United States and an additional 119 named individuals living abroad.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="6XQs2f0yUFR56mF52vLJXT"></sup> </p><p>Nonetheless, the Copyright Office determined the description of the class to be “insufficiently clear” and declined to recommend its adoption.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="4U5eX8KOVVwoZh4Pcnt2Kj"></sup> Notably, the Copyright Office did not take any steps on its own to further explore the context surrounding the exemption request. FloSports’ inability to commit to fully participating in every step of the process proved fatal for its request. </p><h4 class="heading" id="participants-engage-repeatedly-over-decades">Participants Engage Repeatedly Over Decades</h4><p>While this report focuses on the efforts involved with the 2024 proceeding, many of this round’s renewal petitions reflect efforts by the organizations involved that go back decades. Although most of the renewal requests have not been challenged in this cycle, almost all of them were subject to opposition when they were introduced and for a number of cycles thereafter. Proponents of these exemption requests had to engage with the process over multiple triennial cycles before managing to avoid being challenged (again) in 2024.</p><p>As one typical example, the 2024 proceeding includes a request to renew the exemption for motion picture excerpts for use in documentary or other films where use is “in parody or for a biographical or historically significant nature.” (This single exemption renewal required work and time from two nonprofit organizations and two law school clinics: the International Documentary Association and Kartemquin Educational Films (represented by the UCI Intellectual Property, Arts, and Technology Clinic and private counsel),<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="01eMFlI1UgT2pPT5Ncw0u"></sup> as well as New Media Rights.).<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="7pOFA2caRG2mIhoQdgQHJB"></sup> </p><p>No one opposed this exemption request during the current proceeding.  However, the exemption request draws on decades of previous work, with many participants repeating their engagement during each cycle.</p><p>In the first three cycles, there were a number of requests related to accessing motion pictures on DVD: </p><ul><li><p>2000 cycle (an exemption request to access audiovisual works on DVD, not recommended by the Register of Copyrights).<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="1i6yxB2Szn0SAh7YKIDYvM"></sup> </p></li><li><p>2003 cycle (five different exemption requests related to accessing motion pictures on DVD, not recommended by the Register).<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="7E8LsDnMVNdHVvH29QpjKz"></sup> </p></li><li><p>2006 cycle (one exemption for audiovisual works included in the library of an educational institution when circumvention is accomplished for the purpose of making compilations for educational use in the classroom recommended by the Register, two other exemptions related to audiovisual works on DVD that were not recommended by the Register).</p></li></ul><p>The fourth cycle was the first one to include a specific exemption request related to accessing motion pictures on DVD in order to incorporate them into new works.

In return, in the past three years it has provided an additional cause of action in eight cases of enterprise software infringement, four cases of unauthorized use of photographs, four cases of video game cheating, one case of video game system emulation, and one case of publicly playing unreleased video games. All of these cases also included claims of copyright infringement, claims that offer a robust set of options to vindicate the rights of plaintiffs.  </p><p>It appears that the benefits of 1201(a)(1) are limited and largely redundant with existing prohibitions against copyright infringement. In contrast, the burdens imposed by its exemption process are significant and critical to a wide range of socially beneficial activities.</p><p>Congress devoted significant attention to attempting to balance the diffuse costs and benefits to copyright owners and users of copyrighted works created by 1201(a)(1).<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="3nrDsMQlWnjQzqQUfjlltW"></sup> It spent very little, if any, time considering the administrative burden imposed on the public seeking to prevent 1201(a)(1)’s provisions from interfering with legitimate activities. </p><p>Today, the administrative burden that 1201(a)(1) imposes on the public and the government is its most significant impact. This burden far outweighs the marginal benefit that the provision brings to a small number of rights holders. Congress should take steps to reduce that burden by reducing the scope of 1201(a)(1) and streamlining the exemption request process.  </p><h2 class="heading" id="opportunities-for-reform">Opportunities for Reform</h2><p>The unbalanced impact that 1201(a)(1) imposes on the public also presents a number of opportunities for reform.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="1fGAFXJPM8LXoiWCuFlNBW"></sup> These could include:</p><h3 class="heading" id="eliminate-1201-a-1-entirely">Eliminate 1201(a)(1) Entirely</h3><p>Part of Congress’ original justification for 1201(a)(1) was an interest in promoting electronic commerce.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="6gIL1OWhMO5lnxe39baB66"></sup> While electronic commerce has unquestionably thrived since the provision was enacted, the volume of litigation involving it suggests that there is unlikely to be a causal link between the two or real, ongoing value to maintaining 1201(a)(1) at all.  </p><p>A review of litigation initiated during the most recent exemption period indicates that rights holders would not be harmed by an absence of 1201(a)(1). With the exception of the DISH Network unauthorized retransmission case (which also included claims drawn from the Communications Act), every case reviewed as part of this study also included underlying copyright claims. Copyright infringement itself brings the possibility of significant civil penalties.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="6tXoyre7Su9zGCZm6jeehV"></sup> None of the case fact patterns suggest that the plaintiff would have been significantly disadvantaged in vindicating their rights without the ability to bring an additional claim under 1201(a)(1), or that 1201(a)(1) meaningfully contributed to the damages recovered.</p><p>Nonetheless, 1201(a)(1) clearly imposes a burden on a range of public interest organizations and individuals, as well as on activities that are not themselves infringing. A quarter century after its passage, the “balance between the interests of content creators and information users”<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="21p7JYZgF9OuSqtcV932Gh"></sup> that Congress attempted to strike is deeply askew. Removing the provision entirely would represent a significant step toward restoring that balance.</p><h3 class="heading" id="tie-1201-a-1-violations-to-infringing-activity">Tie 1201(a)(1) Violations to Infringing Activity</h3><p>By design, the current triennial process grants additional permission to engage in otherwise infringing work. It therefore creates a burden on activity that is permitted under the law (at worst) and socially beneficial (at best). A review of litigation from the previous period fails to identify cases where rights holders require the flexibility to bring 1201(a)(1) cases absent an underlying copyright infringement. </p><p>Instead of forcing advocates to seek additional permission for otherwise-permitted activities during the triennial process, Congress could revise 1201(a)(1) to require an underlying infringement. This would maintain the original intent that 1201(a)(1) act cumulatively to infringement<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="46tvqPn8KSuCUw0lXDqqG"></sup> while removing the burden on noninfringing uses. </p><p>Such a change would eliminate the burden placed on the public to advocate for its existing rights in the triennial review.</p><h3 class="heading" id="simplify-the-exemption-process">Simplify the Exemption Process</h3><p>If Congress elects to maintain the existing structure of 1201(a)(1), it could still take steps to simplify the triennial exemption process.  </p><p>The Copyright Office has already taken commendable steps in this direction by creating a streamlined process for renewing exemptions for which there is no substantive opposition.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="1RqsvJWNC8U6u61hYe9KuO"></sup> Nonetheless, Congress could reduce the burden on the public further by clarifying that the Copyright Office has the power to renew existing exemptions on its own motion. The Copyright Office itself could then propose renewing exemptions and recommend renewal in the absence of substantive opposition.</p><p>Copyright Office-led renewals would reduce the number of triennial participants in 2024 from 96 to 63. Furthermore, it would avoid situations where exemptions are not renewed because no public interest organization had the capacity to advocate for it. This appears to have been the fate of the current exemption permitting circumvention of video games in the form of computer programs for the purpose of allowing an individual with a physical disability to use alternative software or hardware input methods.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="4bJJ2hlosAIxatve0xgt6S"></sup></p><h3 class="heading" id="fund-the-existing-process">Fund the Existing Process</h3><p>If Congress would prefer not to eliminate or revise 1201(a)(1), or to simplify the existing process, it could allocate funds to compensate the public interest and academic institutions that the triennial process relies on to represent the public.  </p><p>Such models have been discussed for decades<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="aLbTh0HjwPWxmb2G1ERwc"></sup> and would represent an acknowledgement that 1201(a)(1) shifts the burden of representing the public interest away from the government and onto a collection of private actors without a direct financial stake in the outcome.  </p><p>The fate of the FloSports exemption request discussed above highlights the unfunded burden that the current exemption process places on requesters. FloSports submitted an initial request for an exemption to cover recording of live sporting events. However, it was unable or unwilling to continue to participate in the subsequent steps required by the current process. The Copyright Office was unable or unwilling to engage in its own investigation, and no public interest organization assumed responsibility for it. As a result, a potentially useful exemption was not fully explored.</p><p>Support for this advocacy could change that dynamic and help guarantee that the public interest is well represented during the triennial process.</p><h2 class="heading" id="appendix-a-participant-categories">Appendix A: Participant Categories</h2><div class="table"><p class="table__title">Explanation of Categories Used in This Report</p><div class="table__body"><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Academic (Individual)</td><td>Professor with expertise in the relevant field acting on their own behalf</td></tr><tr><td>Academic (Institution)</td><td>Academic institution acting on its own behalf</td></tr><tr><td>Community Org</td><td>Informal or formal organization built around a specific community</td></tr><tr><td>Corporation</td><td>For-profit company</td></tr><tr><td>Government</td><td>Federal agency or commission outside of the Library of Congress</td></tr><tr><td>Individual</td><td>Individual without additional relevant academic credential</td></tr><tr><td>Law Clinic</td><td>Law clinic filing on its own behalf</td></tr><tr><td>Law Clinic (Individual Client)</td><td>Law clinic representing individual clients</td></tr><tr><td>Nonprofit Org</td><td>Nonprofit advocacy organization participating on behalf of its constituency</td></tr><tr><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Industry trade association</td></tr><tr><td>Nonprofit Org (User)</td><td>Nonprofit advocacy organization participating on its own behalf as a user of the proposed exemption</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table__caption"></div></div><h2 class="heading" id="appendix-b-2024-1201-process-participants">Appendix B: 2024 1201 Process Participants</h2><div class="table"><p class="table__title">Participants in the 2024 Section 1201 Process</p><div class="table__body"><table><thead><tr><th>Organization</th><th>Organization Type</th><th>Direct Financial Stake in Exemption?</th><th>Proponent/Opponent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A Group of Hackers at DEF CON</td><td>Community Org</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>AACS LA</td><td>Corporation</td><td>Yes</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed)</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>Aleksandra Korolova</td><td>Academic (individual)</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Alliance for Automotive Innovation (Auto Innovators)</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>American Association of Univeristy Professors</td><td>Nonprofit org</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>American Consumer Institute</td><td>Nonprofit org</td><td>No</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>American Council of the Blind</td><td>Nonprofit org</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>American Farm Bureau Federation</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>American Federation for the Blind</td><td>Nonprofit org</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Anonymous 1*</td><td>Individual</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Anonymous 2*</td><td>Individual</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Arvind Narayanan</td><td>Academic (individual)</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Associated Equipment Distributors</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>Association of American Publishers</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>Association of Equipment Manufacturers</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM)</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>Association of Transcribers and Speech-to-Text Providers (note they have $13K in the bank according to the 2021 annual report)</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Author Services, Inc.</td><td>Corporation</td><td>No</td><td>Opponent</td></tr><tr><td>Authors Alliance</td><td>Nonprofit org</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Auto Care Association</td><td>Nonprofit Org (Trade Association)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Bobette Buster</td><td>Academic (individual)</td><td>No</td><td>Proponent</td></tr><tr><td>Brigham Young University -
