Because the materials in question all come with an additional constraint—they are protected with digital locks. A professor hoping to show movie clips in her media studies class must first break those digital locks to copy the clips in question. And that’s a problem. Breaking a digital lock can be a violation of the law, even if done to make otherwise-lawful use of a copyrighted work.</p><p>And this is why 96 nonprofit organizations, law school clinics, trade associations, academics, companies, and individuals submitted over 1,000 pages of petitions, comments, opposition comments, and reply comments (in addition to participating in three days of public hearings) to the United States Copyright Office during this period, asking for permission to do things that they already are allowed to do under fair use.  </p><p>Nor is it the first time everyone has come together for this ritual. Since 2000, every three years they must come together to request—and oppose—limited exemptions to a law designed to protect the digital locks that prevent copying of digital works. These exceptions act as an additional round of permission for activities that, but for the use of digital locks, would already be protected under copyright law’s fair use exception.</p><p>This exercise exists because of 1998’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). That law created a specific provision—section 1201(a)(1)—giving additional legal protection to digital locks that prevent copying of digital works, independent of the copyright protection those works already enjoy. Circumventing the locks is a stand-alone violation of the law, even if the reason for the circumvention is perfectly legal.  </p><p>In order to prevent that additional protection from undermining socially beneficial activity, Congress created a process whereby temporary exemptions to the rules could be granted every three years.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="4E8jrOknniJiysMEW4l3eZ"></sup></p><p>Congress originally intended this triennial process to act as “a ‘fail-safe’ mechanism” to “ensure that access [to works] for lawful purposes is not unjustifiably diminished.” While the process does serve that goal, it has also become a central focus of copyright policy advocacy in its own right. It now claims countless hours of effort from the participants, as well as from Copyright Office staff and other parts of the federal government, on behalf of an ever-expanding collection of exemptions.  </p><p>At the same time, the law these exemptions are from is only occasionally used in court. Only 12 suits with a meaningful nexus to 1201(a)(1) were filed during the period covered by the previous triennial rules, five of which came from a single manufacturer of high-end design software. Each of these included underlying copyright claims, arguably making the law redundant. If the intended purpose of the law was the protection of creative works in the digital economy, the actual effect of the law is the creation of a bureaucratic sinkhole that draws in public interest organizations, academics, industry organizations, and the public every three years. They must do this, in part, because the government does not see its role as acting on behalf of the public interest itself. </p><p>Ultimately, the resources devoted to the bureaucratic process of exemption-granting almost certainly dwarf those devoted to enforcing the law itself. It is time to reexamine how well this provision “maintain[s] balance between the interests of content creators and information users” and consider reforming it or abolishing it entirely.</p><h2 class="heading" id="what-was-section-1201-a-1-designed-to-do">What Was Section 1201(a)(1) Designed to Do?</h2><p>The prohibition against circumventing digital locks is contained in 17 U.S.C § 1201(a)(1), itself enacted as part of the larger Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). </p><p>Section 1201(a)(1) establishes a violation for “circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work [protected by copyright]”. Essentially, this prohibits breaking or otherwise circumventing a digital lock that protects a work protected by copyright.  </p><p>(The provision describes digital locks used to limit the use of copyright-protected works as “technological measures,” and in other contexts they are referred to as “Technological Protection Measures (TPMs).” However, as most people know these locks as Digital Rights Management (DRM), in the interest of simplicity, that is the term used in this report.)</p><p>Section 1201(a)(1) creates an additional cause of action against copyright infringers. For example, making unauthorized copies of a movie in order to sell those copies to others infringes on the copyright in the movie itself. If that movie happens to be on a DVD, and is therefore protected by DRM, 1201(a)(1) creates an <i>additional</i> violation for breaking the digital lock that protects the movie as stored on the DVD. Because 1201(a)(1) is an additional violation, the bootlegger in question would be liable for both copyright infringement (making unauthorized copies of the movie) and circumvention (breaking the digital locks designed to prevent unauthorized copying in the first place).</p><p>Congress recognized that this new circumvention-based violation could also impose significant burdens on the public and act as a barrier to socially beneficial (and perfectly lawful) activity. In recognition of this, Congress wrote exceptions into the law itself for specific activities of libraries, archives, and educational institutions; law enforcement, intelligence, and other government activities; reverse engineering; encryption research; and security testing.</p><h3 class="heading" id="the-triennial-review-process-as-backstop">The Triennial Review Process as Backstop</h3><p>Congress understood that the prohibition against circumventing DRM would impact lawful uses of works beyond those explicitly listed in the statute. However, it did not create a general “fair use exemption” that would allow the breaking of digital locks in order to achieve otherwise legal ends.  </p><p>Instead, in addition to an enumerated list of specific exceptions, Congress created a triennial process to identify additional activity harmed by the prohibition against circumventing digital locks. As described in the legislative report accompanying the bill, “[t]he primary goal of the rulemaking proceeding is to assess whether the prevalence of these technological protections [DRM], with respect to particular categories of copyrighted materials, is diminishing the ability of individuals to use these works in ways that are otherwise lawful.” </p><p>Every three years the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress consider petitions from groups asserting that their noninfringing uses of copyright-protected works “are, or are likely to be, adversely affected” by rules preventing them from breaking digital locks. This process is intended to “balance the interests of copyright owners and users, including the personal interests of consumers, in the digital environment.” Although 1201(a)(1) sets a presumption that breaking digital locks is illegal, the triennial review process is an opportunity to allow the breaking of those locks for legitimate purposes. Notably, exemptions granted through this process remain valid only until the completion of the next triennial review process–meaning they are good only for three years.</p><p>The mechanics of the review process have evolved over the past two decades, becoming somewhat more streamlined in recent years. The most recent, streamlined version includes the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>The Copyright Office announces the start of the process. (The most recent process began on June 8, 2023.)</p></li><li><p>Supporters of existing exemptions file a request to renew those exemptions, including an explanation of why the exemption should be renewed. (July 7)</p></li><li><p>Opponents of existing exemptions file comments opposing the renewal of those exemptions. (Supporters of existing exemptions can still file comments supporting the exemptions at this stage.) (August 11)</p></li><li><p>Supporters of new exemptions file a petition for the new exemption, or for the modification of an existing exemption. (August 25)</p></li><li><p>The Copyright Office announces which existing exemptions it will support the renewal of, and which new or existing exemptions will be open to further comment from the public and other government agencies. In the current (2024) round, the Copyright Office supported the renewal of 38 existing exemptions. It failed to support the renewal of a 39th existing exemption because no parties submitted a petition for its renewal. (October 19)</p></li><li><p>Proponents of exemptions file comments in support of those exemptions. (December 22)</p></li><li><p>Opponents of new exemptions file comments in opposition to those exemptions. (February 20, 2024)</p></li><li><p>Supporters of new exemptions file reply comments to the comments opposing the proposed exemption. (March 19)</p></li><li><p>The Copyright Office holds a series of public hearings featuring proponents and opponents of the exemptions. (April 16-18)</p></li><li><p>Hearing participants submit additional responses to questions raised during the hearing. (May 28)</p></li><li><p>The Register of Copyrights releases their recommendations with regard to the exemptions. (October)</p></li><li><p>The Librarian of Congress formally approves and publishes the recommendations. (October 28)</p></li></ol><p>While this final step is required because the statute identifies the Librarian of Congress as the final authority on the matter, it is largely pro forma. The entire process is managed by the Copyright Office, and there is only one instance where the Librarian of Congress reversed a recommendation from the Register of Copyrights. </p><h2 class="heading" id="the-triennial-review-process-imposes-significant-costs-on-the-public">The Triennial Review Process Imposes Significant Costs on the Public</h2><p>Although intended as a backstop to ensure that the public interest remains protected, the triennial review of proposed exemptions to 1201(a)(1) instead imposes significant costs on the public. Every three years, organizations and individuals must petition the Copyright Office to propose new exemptions to reflect the evolving state of technology and society. And, because all previously granted exemptions expire at the end of their three-year cycle, petitioners also have to request renewals or alterations for prior exemptions. These petitions are sometimes challenged by parties opposed to the exemptions, and they must be reviewed by Copyright Office staff.</p><p>Although Congress established a framework for the review process, there does not appear to be any record of it seriously considering the costs involved in its operation. Instead, it appears to have simply assumed that the petitions for exemptions in the public interest would materialize before the Copyright Office every three years.  </p><p>In practice, the work of drafting, supporting, and arguing for these petitions largely falls to uncompensated nonprofit organizations, academics, and law school clinics. Collectively, they represent thousands of hours spent advocating for the public’s ability to do what is already allowed under copyright law. This combined effort may be 1201(a)(1)’s most significant impact—an impact that is felt not by the copyright holder, who is already well protected by copyright law without it, but instead by public interest organizations that must find the capacity and time to participate in an extra bureaucratic procedure.</p><h3 class="heading" id="proceeding-participants">Proceeding Participants</h3><p>Every three years, the review process requires the mobilization of dozens of organizations and individuals for a multi-month adjudication process. The most recent proceeding involved 96 parties engaged with 22 renewal petitions and nine new exemption requests. Each of these petitions and requests involves hours of research, drafting, and coordination with similarly-situated individuals and groups.</p><p>This collective effort is required in part because the Copyright Office, although it recognizes its own authority to engage in independent fact-finding, does not exercise that authority or see itself as a representative of the public interest in this proceeding. Instead, it positions itself as balancing the interests of the broader public against the interests of a smaller group of rights holders. The structure of the proceeding assumes that the public interest will be represented by uncompensated third parties, not the government itself. It also means that, unless these uncompensated third parties find a way to act, no one represents the public interest at all.  </p><h4 class="heading" id="participants-must-have-resources-for-sustained-engagement">Participants Must Have Resources for Sustained Engagement</h4><p>The structure of the proceeding—spread out across multiple phases over more than a year—requires sustained, specialized engagement from anyone requesting an exemption. Simply raising an issue in the hopes that the Copyright Office itself will use its authority to explore it further is not enough. </p><p>For example, in 2021, FloSports, Inc. petitioned the Copyright Office for an exemption related to recording livestreamed sporting events. As per the Copyright Office’s instructions, the petition provided information about the proposed exemption, the copyrighted works sought to be accessed, technological prevention measures (DRM) preventing such access, the noninfringing uses involved, and the adverse effects that the absence of the circumvention imposed.</p><p>Although FloSports provided this information during the petition round of the proceeding, it did not participate in the more formal comment round that followed months later. The Free Software Foundation did engage with the petition in the comment round, submitting a comment in support of FloSports’ petition that was co-signed by 111 named individuals living in the United States and an additional 119 named individuals living abroad. </p><p>Nonetheless, the Copyright Office determined the description of the class to be “insufficiently clear” and declined to recommend its adoption. Notably, the Copyright Office did not take any steps on its own to further explore the context surrounding the exemption request. FloSports’ inability to commit to fully participating in every step of the process proved fatal for its request. </p><h4 class="heading" id="participants-engage-repeatedly-over-decades">Participants Engage Repeatedly Over Decades</h4><p>While this report focuses on the efforts involved with the 2024 proceeding, many of this round’s renewal petitions reflect efforts by the organizations involved that go back decades. Although most of the renewal requests have not been challenged in this cycle, almost all of them were subject to opposition when they were introduced and for a number of cycles thereafter. Proponents of these exemption requests had to engage with the process over multiple triennial cycles before managing to avoid being challenged (again) in 2024.</p><p>As one typical example, the 2024 proceeding includes a request to renew the exemption for motion picture excerpts for use in documentary or other films where use is “in parody or for a biographical or historically significant nature.” (This single exemption renewal required work and time from two nonprofit organizations and two law school clinics: the International Documentary Association and Kartemquin Educational Films (represented by the UCI Intellectual Property, Arts, and Technology Clinic and private counsel), as well as New Media Rights.). </p><p>No one opposed this exemption request during the current proceeding.  However, the exemption request draws on decades of previous work, with many participants repeating their engagement during each cycle.</p><p>In the first three cycles, there were a number of requests related to accessing motion pictures on DVD: </p><ul><li><p>2000 cycle (an exemption request to access audiovisual works on DVD, not recommended by the Register of Copyrights). </p></li><li><p>2003 cycle (five different exemption requests related to accessing motion pictures on DVD, not recommended by the Register). </p></li><li><p>2006 cycle (one exemption for audiovisual works included in the library of an educational institution when circumvention is accomplished for the purpose of making compilations for educational use in the classroom recommended by the Register, two other exemptions related to audiovisual works on DVD that were not recommended by the Register).</p></li></ul><p>The fourth cycle was the first one to include a specific exemption request related to accessing motion pictures on DVD in order to incorporate them into new works. It effectively set the terms for each subsequent cycle, engaging a large collection of participants each time:</p><ul><li><p>2010 cycle (for the first time, a specific exemption request to access motion pictures on DVD for the purpose of incorporation of short clips into new works for specified purposes), requested by Kartemquin Educational Films and the International Documentary Association—represented by the U.S.C. Intellectual Property and Technology Law Clinic and private counsel—and opposed by the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. (“DVD CCA”), the Motion Picture Association of America, and a combined opposition of the Association of American Publishers, American Society of Media Photographers, Alliance of Visual Artists, Business Software Alliance, Directors Guild of America, Entertainment Software Association, Motion Picture Association of America, Picture Archive Council of America, and Recording Industry Association of America, Time Warner, Inc., further supported by David P. Hayes and VAMP Productions, recommended by the Register.</p></li><li><p>2012 cycle (a specific exemption request to access motion pictures on DVDs and Blu-Ray for the purpose of incorporating short clips into new works for specified purposes, requested by the International Documentary Association, Kartemquin Educational Films, National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture, and Independent Filmmaker Project—represented by the U.S.C. Intellectual Property and Technology Law Clinic and private counsel—opposed by the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, DVD CCA, a combined opposition of the Association of American Publishers, American Society of Media Photographers, Business Software Alliance, Entertainment Software Association, Motion Picture Association of America, Picture Archive Council of America, and Recording Industry Association of America, and supported by a combination of Film Independent, Chicago Filmmakers, Kindling Group, Kirby Dick, Jeffrey Kusama-Hinte, J S Mayank, David Novack, and Laurence Thrush, the University Film &amp; Video Association, Ann Breuer, Elizabeth Coffman, a combination of Peter Decherney, Katherine Sender, Michael X. Delli Carpini, International Communications Association, Society for Cinema and Media Studies, and American Association of University Professors, and Philadelphia Independent Film and Video Association, recommended by the Register).</p></li><li><p>2015 cycle (a specific exemption request to access motion pictures on DVDs, Blu-Ray, and digitally transmitted video for the purpose of incorporating short clips into new works for specified purposes), requested by the International Documentary Association, Kartemquin Educational Films, and National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture (represented by the UCI Intellectual Property, Arts, and Technology Clinic and private counsel), opposed by Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, DVD CCA, and a combination of the Entertainment Software Association, Motion Picture Association of America, and Recording Industry Association of America, and supported by New Media Rights, 1,565 individual comments received through the Digital Right to Repair website, the Free Software Foundation, a combination of Film Independent, Indie Caucus, University Film and Video Association, Center for Independent Documentary, Women in Film in Video, and Women in Film,  recommended by the Register.     </p></li><li><p>2018 cycle (a petition to renew the previously granted exemption, requested by the Film Independent, International Documentary Association, Kartemquin Educational Films, Center for Independent Documentary, and Women in Film and Video—represented by the UCI Intellectual Property, Arts, and Technology Clinic and private counsel—as well as New Media Rights, opposed by Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, DVD CCA, and a combination of the Motion Picture Association of America, Entertainment Software Association, Recording Industry Association of America, and the Association of American Publishers, and supported by a combination of Authors Alliance, The American Association of University Professors, Organization for Transformative Works, Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation, and Bobette Buster—represented by the UCI Intellectual Property, Arts, and Technology Clinic and Samuelson-Glushko Technology Law &amp; Policy Clinic—a combination of Brigham Young University and Brigham Young University-Idaho, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Free Software Foundation, a combination of Peter Decherney, Michael X.

This total does not include the 1,565 individual comments collected by the Digital Right to Repair website during the 2015 cycle, or the time spent preparing for and participating in live hearings for each cycle over the period of time. Copyright Office staff reviewed each of these submissions and discussed them at length in recommendation reports.     </p><p>This entire corpus of work represents a debate over special rules governing activity that would be paradigmatic fair use in any other circumstance: using short clips of a work for criticism or commentary. It also represents one of dozens of requests in each cycle.</p><h4 class="heading" id="most-participants-support-exemptions">Most Participants Support Exemptions</h4><p>In the 2024 cycle, the vast majority of exemption participants supported exemptions. Those proponents tend to be nonprofit organizations or academics, often supported by law clinics, advocating on behalf of a wide range of exemptions for a diverse set of users. </p><div class="chart-container" id="chart-1-proponents-and-opponents-0yhNXcqqGtBS18zpIPme6" data-unit="count"><h4 class="chart-title">Chart 1.

Instead, in most cases, such groups represent a broader public interest. This ad hoc collection of participants organizes itself to petition for exemptions. The Copyright Office notice that kicks off the triennial review simply states that it will receive and review exemption requests “from the public” and “interested parties,” assuming that such parties will have the means to engage in the entirety of the exemption process. </p><p>Chart 1 thus makes a distinction between nonprofit trade associations and other nonprofits. Nonprofit trade associations often participate in the proceeding on behalf of members that have direct financial interest in the outcome. While trade associations do not themselves directly benefit from the exemptions requested, they represent commercially interested members who would. That separates them from nonprofit organizations working in the public interest more broadly. </p><p>Chart 2 illustrates the trade association/nonprofit distinction more clearly, revealing that a significant majority of the participants (both exemption proponents and opponents) do not have a direct or indirect financial benefit in the outcome. </p><div class="chart-container" id="chart-2-financial-relationship-of-participants-to-outcome-4gPJCI54zy9WeWZgjLf0qW" data-unit="count"><h4 class="chart-title">Chart 2.
