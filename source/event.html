  title: 2022 Tri-State IP Workshop
  date: December 9, 2022
  introduction: The Colloquium on Innovation Policy focuses each year on different aspects of the lawâ€™s role in promoting creativity, invention, and new technology. This year, we will examine innovation in the health care field, looking at such matters as the relationship between intellectual property, encouraging medical advances, and assuring appropriate public access to these advances; the special problem of developing countries; and competition issues related to innovation and intellectual property. We will mostly consider these questions through the lens of the COVID pandemic.
