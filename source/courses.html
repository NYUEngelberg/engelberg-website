    description: The TRIPS Intellectual Property Waiver Proposal&#58; Creating the Right Incentives in Patent Law and Politics to end the COVID-19 Pandemic
    abstract: Abstract&#58; Addressing Vaccine Inequity examines global vaccine inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic. We critique intellectual property (IP) law under the 1995 WTO TRIPS Agreement, and specifically, the role that IP plays in enabling the inequities of production, distribution and pricing in the COVID-19 vaccine context. Given the failure of international response mechanisms, including COVAX and C-TAP, to address vaccine inequity, we argue the TRIPS waiver proposal offers a necessary and proportionate legal measure for clearing IP barriers that cannot be achieved by TRIPS flexibilities. Finally, we reflect on the waiver in the wider context of TRIPS, addressing TRIPS' successes and failures. TRIPS Waiver is a work in progress that discusses the plea for TRIPS waiver as a plea for greater degrees of transnational private ordering to emerge to meet public health goals.
